          A living showcase of biomedical engineering.
          
          In high school, I dreamt to be a medical doctor, save lives and make a difference in a hospital setting. Life had other plans...

          I graduated (BSc & MSc) in Biomedical Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), with specialization in imaging, biosignals and biomedical instrumentation. 

          Side-quested alone for 6 months at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU) Copenhagen, Denmark for an Erasmus Programme.

          To further explore my Master's Thesis work, I was awarded two research grants from FCT to study the role of cytoskeletons and nuclei in cancer cells at the Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR-Lisboa).
          
          Fell in love with my work and was awarded a PhD fellowship from FCT to pursue my research interests at IST/ISR.

          Throughout my journey, I had the opportunity to participate in outreach and dissemination activities promoted by IST and ISR, was involved in teaching activities in the Biomedical Engineering BSc at IST, and attended several national and international meetings.

          Right now, I am a visiting researcher at the Wirtz / Wu Lab at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore, USA.
